"We performed multiple regression analysis, in which regional gray matter volume was used as a dependent variable, and age, sex, duration of sleep, and intracranial volume were used as independent variables to investigate the correlation between hippocampal regional gray matter volume and duration of sleep. Intracranial volume was calculated by summing the gray matter, white matter, and CSF volumes derived from the aforementioned imaging process." (all in SPM8 which is a MRI analysis software I've used)
"volume of the bilateral hippocampal body was significantly positively correlated with the duration of sleep during weekdays after adjusting for age, sex, and intracranial volume and after performing small-volume correction of the hippocampal ROI" (290 healthy children aged 5–18 years)

"Higher scores on the ISI, indicating worse insomnia, were associated with smaller volumes of the CA3/dentate subfields (r = −.48, p < .01) in the combined sample. Adding the ISI score as a predictor for CA3/dentate volume to a hierarchical linear regression model after first controlling for age and PTSD symptoms accounted for a 13% increase in incremental variance (t = −2.47, p = .02)."

Super small pilot study - just did spearmann correlations with 8 primary insomnia and 8 controls and found that patients with primary insomnia had reduced bilateral hippocampus volume

Older review of neural effects of sleep loss

Nardo 2015: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00134/full
"higher sleep disturbances were associated with significantly reduced gray matter volume in amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and insula; This pattern was substantially confirmed in the PTSD group, but not in controls."

Hippocampal Volume in Older Adults at Risk of Cognitive Decline: 218 adults (mean age 67 years)
"Smaller hippocampal volumes were strongly associated with poorer verbal learning and memory as well as diagnoses of either multiple or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Based on univariate correlations, multivariable regressions were performed (controlling for age and total intracranial volume) to determine which modifiable risk factors were associated with hippocampal volume. For the left hippocampus, poor sleep efficiency and greater than five years untreated depressive illness remained significant predictors. For the right hippocampus, diabetes and low diastolic blood pressure remained significant predictors."
"Although their contribution is small, lower sleep efficiency, low blood pressure, diabetes, and untreated depression are associated with reduced hippocampal volumes. Studies exploring the impact of early intervention for these risk factors on hippocampal integrity are warranted."

"multiple linear regressions, controlling for age, sex, education, sleep medication, and depression, to examine sleep characteristics in relation to hippocampal volume and cognitive performance in all the subjects and then stratified by cognition."
Didn't find any significant relationships with hippocampal volume (adults 90+)
Has a good review of hippocampal volume + sleep research in the intro
